Start Project!

## Canvas-LMS API Documentation 

* [API Documentation](http://instructure.github.com/canvas-lms/doc/api/basics.html)
* API Uses Basic HTTP Auth for each request. (Changed).
* Basic HTTP Auth is now deprecated, switched login to use access token generated by user.

## Next Steps:

* Login Screen Created
* Add HTTP Request Objects
* Setup Canvas Production Server (switched to quick server, production server is to slow running on 1 computer)

## Issues:

* Basic HTTP Auth on logout will not change users until restart of app. (switched to access token)
* Unable to access submission file links without logging on website, even with access token in URL.
